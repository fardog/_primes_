_primes_
========

**Note:** This code is deprecated; it's been replaced by [primebot][] which is
more maintainable, and works on multiple social networks.

_primes_ is a prime number calculator that uses twitter as its storage backend;
you can follow [@\_primes\_](https://twitter.com/_primes_) to see the magic. It 
works as follows:

1. Start up
2. Fetch the most recently calculated prime from the Twitter feed.
3. Calculate the next prime.
4. Post if an hour has passed since the last posting. Wait if not.
5. Steps 2â€“4 forever.

With the speed that the average machine can calculate prime numbers, it should 
be several decades before processor time becomes an issue.
